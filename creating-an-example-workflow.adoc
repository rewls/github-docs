= Creating an example workflow

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a basic workflow that is
triggered by a push event.

== Introduction

* This guide shows you how to create a basic workflow that is triggered when
  code is pushed to your repository.

'''

* To get started with preconfigured workflows, browse through the list of
  templates in the link:[actions/starter-workflows] repository.
* For more information, see link:[Using workflow templates].

[IMPORTANT]
====
* For more information about best practices for securing your workflows and
  secure use of GitHub Actions features, see Secure use reference.
====

== Creating an example workflow

* GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow.
* Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in
  a directory named `.github/workflows`.

'''

* You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically
  triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed.
* In this workflow, GitHub Actions checks out the pushed code, installs the
  link:[bats] testing framework, and runs a basic command to output the bats
  version: `bats -v`.

'''

1. In your repository, create the `.github/workflows/` directory to store your
   workflow files.
2. In the `.github/workflows/` directory, create a new file called
   `learn-github-actions.yml` and add the following code.
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: learn-github-actions
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
----
3. Commit these changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

'''

* Your new GitHub Actions workflow file is now installed in your repository
  and will run automatically each time someone pushes a change to the
  repository.
* To see the details about a workflow's execution history, see link:[Viewing
  the activity for a workflow run].

== Understanding the workflow file

* To help you understand how YAML syntax is used to create a workflow file,
  this section explains each line of the introduction's example:

[%autowidth,cols="a,a"]
|===
|
[source,yaml]
name: learn-github-actions
|
* Optional - The name of the workflow as it will appear in the "Actions" tab
  of the GitHub repository.
* If this field is omitted, the name of the workflow file will be used
  instead.

|
[source,yaml]
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions
|
* Optional - The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow, which
  will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab.
* This example uses an expression with the github context to display the
  username of the actor that triggered the workflow run.
* For more information, see link:[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions].

|
[source,yaml]
on: [push]
|
* Specifies the trigger for this workflow.
* This example uses the push event, so a workflow run is triggered every time
  someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request.
* This is triggered by a push to every branch; for examples of syntax that
  runs only on pushes to specific branches, paths, or tags, see Workflow
  syntax for GitHub Actions.

|
[source,yaml]
jobs:
|
* Groups together all the jobs that run in the `learn-github-actions`
  workflow.

|
[source,yaml]
  check-bats-version:
|
* Defines a job named `check-bats-version`.
* The child keys will define properties of the job.

|
[source,yaml]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
|
* Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner.
* This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by
  GitHub.
* For syntax examples using other runners, see link:[Workflow syntax for
  GitHub Actions]

|
[source,yaml]
    steps:
|
* Groups together all the steps that run in the `check-bats-version` job.
* Each item nested under this section is a separate action or shell script.

|
[source,yaml]
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
|
* The `uses` keyword specifies that this step will run `v4` of the
  `actions/checkout` action.
* #This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing
  you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and
  test tools).#
* You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will use the
  repository's code.

|
[,yaml]
----
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
----
|
* This step uses the `actions/setup-node@v4` action to install the specified
  version of the Node.js.
* (This example uses version 20.)
* This puts both the `node` and `npm` commands in your `PATH`.

|
[source,yaml]
      - run: npm install -g bats
|
* The `run` keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner.
* In this case, you are using `npm` to install the `bats` software testing
  package.

|
[source,yaml]
      - run: bats -v
|
* Finally, you'll run the `bats` command with a parameter that outputs the
  software version.
|===

=== Visualizing the workflow file

* In this diagram, you can see the workflow file you just created and how the
  GitHub Actions components are organized in a hierarchy.
* Each step executes a single action or shell script.
* Steps 1 and 2 run actions, while steps 3 and 4 run shell scripts.
* To find more prebuilt actions for your workflows, see link:[Using
  pre-written building blocks in your workflow].

== Viewing the activity for a workflow run

* When your workflow is triggered, a workflow run is created that executes the
  workflow.
* After a workflow run has started, you can see a visualization graph of the
  run's progress and view each step's activity on GitHub.

'''

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click btn:[Actions].
3. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
4. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run to see the
   workflow run summary.
5. In the left sidebar or in the visualization graph, click the job you want
   to see.
6. To view the results of a step, click the step.
