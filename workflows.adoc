Get a high-level overview of GitHub Actions workflows, including triggers,
syntax, and advanced features.

== About workflows

* #A *workflow* is a configurable automated process that will run one or more
  jobs.#
* Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will
  run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered
  manually, or at a defined schedule.

'''

* Workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory in a repository.
* A repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a
  different set of tasks such as:
** Building and testing pull requests
** Deploying your application every time a release is created
** Adding a label whenever a new issue is opened

== Workflow basics

* A workflow must contain the following basic components:
1. One or more _events_ that will trigger the workflow.
2. One or more _jobs_, each of which will execute on a _runner_ machine and run
   a series of one or more _steps_.
3. Each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which
   is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

'''

* For more information on these basic components, see link:[Understanding
  GitHub Actions].

== Workflow triggers

* Workflow triggers are events that cause a workflow to run.
* These events can be:
** Events that occur in your workflow's repository
** Events that occur outside of GitHub and trigger a `repository_dispatch`
   event on GitHub
** Scheduled times
** Manual

* For example, you can configure your workflow to run when a push is made to
  the default branch of your repository, when a release is created, or when an
  issue is opened.

* Workflow triggers are defined with the `on` key.
* For more information, see link:[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions].

'''

* The following steps occur to trigger a workflow run:
1. An event occurs on your repository. +
   The event has an associated commit SHA and Git ref.
2. GitHub searches the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your
   repository for workflow files that are present in the associated commit SHA
   or Git ref of the event.
3. A workflow run is triggered for any workflows that have `on:` values that
   match the triggering event. +
   Some events also require the workflow file to be present on the default
   branch of the repository in order to run.

* Each workflow run will use the version of the workflow that is present in
  the associated commit SHA or Git ref of the event.
* When a workflow runs, GitHub sets the `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and
  `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) environment variables in the runner environment.
* For more information, see link:[Store information in variables].
